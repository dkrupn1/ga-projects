**Overall:**
Great work!

**Some notes**  
* In your data dictionary, note that GRE and GPA are real valued, continuous variables.
* Your bonus section is very creative! When we get to the next homework, I encourage you to follow through on this plan. There are some other considerations though. For example, there are some missing values in the dataset, so how will you deal with those? If you do detect outliers, how should they be treated in your analysis? Additionally, note that while this exploratory analysis is integral to finding a support for your hypothesis, ultimately we will be building models! What kind of models could we build to _classify_ a student as admitted and not admitted?
